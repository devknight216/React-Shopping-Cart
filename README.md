*I'm migrating the app from SASS to Styled Components and removing Redux to make things more simpler for people who are just starting to learn React and use this project to study. If you'd like to contribute just checkout to `update-project-cleanup-and-modernize` branch.*


## Basic Overview - [Live Demo](https://react-shopping-cart-67954.firebaseapp.com/)

This simple shopping cart prototype shows how React components and Redux can be used to build a
friendly user experience with instant visual updates and scaleable code in ecommerce applications.

#### Features

- Add and remove products from the floating cart
- Sort products by highest to lowest and lowest to highest price
- Filter products by available sizes
- Products persist in floating cart after page reloads
- Unit tests, integration tests and e2e testing
- Responsive design

## Getting started
